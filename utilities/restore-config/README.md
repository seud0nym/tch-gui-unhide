# Configuration Restore

These scripts are auto-downloaded by the `restore-config.sh` script, which is automatically created in the backups directory by an execution of the [`mtd-backup`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#mtd-backup) script when both the `-c` and `-o` parameters are specified.

This goes beyond the simple "dump-and-load" approach of the built-in configuration export and import. It will also:
- re-install missing packages;
- restore services status (i.e. enabled and disabled status); and
- automatically re-run the [`de-telstra`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#de-telstra) and [`tch-gui-unhide`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide#readme) scripts with their original parameters.

It can be used to:
- upgrade firmware without tediously re-entering all your configuration; and
- restore configuration to a replacement device (even to a different Technicolor variant and firmware version) should a primary device fail.

**WARNING: A working internet connection is *REQUIRED* on the device to be restored!**

## restore-config.sh Options
```
Usage: restore-config.sh [options] <overlay-files-backup>

Where:
  <overlay-files-backup>  
      is the name of the overlay files backup tgz file from which the 
      configuration will be restored. 
        e.g. DJA0231-CP1234S6789-20.3.c.0329-overlay-files-backup.tgz
      If not specified, it will attempt to find a backup by matching
      on device variant, serial number and optionally firmware version.

Options:
  -i n.n.n.n  Use LAN IP address n.n.n.n instead of the IP address in
                the backup.
  -n          Do NOT reboot after restoring the configuration.
                This is NOT recommended.
  -t          Enable test mode. In test mode:
                - Wi-Fi will be disabled;
                - Dynamic DNS will be disabled;
                - Telephony will be disabled; and
                - "-TEST" is appended to the hostname and browser tabs 
                    if the serial number in the backup does not match
                    the device.
  -v          Enable debug messages. 
                Use twice for verbose messages.
  -y          Bypass confirmation prompt (answers 'y')
```

**NOTE:** You do *not* need to have downloaded [`de-telstra`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#de-telstra) and/or [`tch-gui-unhide`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide#readme); the restore will either locate these scripts or download them as needed.

## Known Issues
- You can only restore to a device running the 20.4 or 21.4 firmware (e.g. Telstra Smart Modem Gen 3) from a backup made on 20.4 or 21.4 firmware (i.e. you *cannot* restore a 20.3.c backup to a 20.4 device or vice-versa)
- /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys is sometimes emptied rather than replaced/updated.
- Telephony call logs are not restored.
- Probably other things I haven't noticed.

## Examples

### Firmware Upgrade

1. Download the up-to-date versions of [`mtd-backup`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#mtd-backup) and [`reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root):
      - `./mtd-backup -U`
      - `./reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root -U`
2. Insert a USB stick into the device.
3. Backup the MTD partitions, the overlay content, the environment and the current configuration:
      - `./mtd-backup -ceo0lvy`
4. Download the firmware .rbi file to the USB stick.
5. Upgrade the firmware and restore the current configuration:
      - `./reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root -f firmware.rbi --restore-config`  
(Replace `firmware.rbi` with the name of your firmware file)
6. The device will reboot *twice* and then you should be on the new firmware with your restored configuration.

If there are any issues with your updated firmware and configuration, you can revert to the previous version with `./mtd-restore -fsr`.

### Alternate Firmware Upgrade (without mtd backup protection)

1. Download the up-to-date version of [`reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root):
      - `./reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root -U`
2. Insert a USB stick into the device.
3. Download the firmware .rbi file to the USB stick.
4. Upgrade the firmware and backup/restore the current configuration:
      - `./reset-to-factory-defaults-with-root -b -f firmware.rbi --restore-config`  
(Replace `firmware.rbi` with the name of your firmware file)
5. The device will reboot *twice* and then you should be on the new firmware with your restored configuration.

### Restore Configuration to New Device After Failure

(*This assumes you have scheduled daily backups of your device to USB by running* `./mtd-backup -C` *to create the cron task, and that the new device has been factory reset and root access acquired.*)

1. Remove the USB stick from the dead device and insert it into the replacement device.
2. Restore the original configuration:
      - `cd /mnt/usb/USB-A1/backups`
      - `./restore-config.sh `*`original_variant`*`-`*`original_serial`*`-`*`original_firmware`*`-overlay-files-backup.tgz`
3. Once the device reboots, your configuration should have been restored.

### Testing

(*This assumes your test device has been factory reset and root access acquired.*)

1. Remove the USB stick from the original device and insert it into the test device.
2. Restore the original configuration in test mode:
      - `cd /mnt/usb/USB-A1/backups`
      - `./restore-config.sh -vvt `*`original_variant`*`-`*`original_serial`*`-`*`original_firmware`*`-overlay-files-backup.tgz`
3. Once the device reboots, your original configuration should have been restored to the test device.
      - The IP address of the test device will be unchanged.
      - The hostname and browser tabs will have `-TEST` appended to easily identify the test device.
      - Wi-Fi will be disabled (because the SSIDs are copied from the original device and may impact day-to-day use if left enabled)
      - Telephony will be disabled (because you can't have 2 devices registering for the same number)
      - Dynamic DDNS will be disabled (because it is a test)

## Extensibility

The extension scripts in this folder restore the major configuration elements that can be configured through a device with both [`de-telstra`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/utilities#de-telstra) and [`tch-gui-unhide`](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide#readme) applied.

However, these scripts may not restore some other custom configuration that you have applied to your device.

To allow your custom configuration to be included in the restore process, you can create your own extension configuration restore script and place it in the `backups\restore-config` directory on your USB device.

### Script Naming Rules

- All script names are prefixed by a 3-digit decimal number, followed by a dash (`-`) then a name describing their function and ending with the `.sh` suffix.
- Script numbers in the range 000-099 are reserved for configuring the restore environment and executing the extension scripts.
- Do not duplicate an existing number. There are plenty of gaps between existing scripts.

Scripts are executed in sequence using their prefix number. Carefully consider the order in which your additional scripts should be executed.

### Script Environment

The extension scripts have access to the following environment when they execute:
