# Unlock the GUI on your Telstra Technicolor Device

The tch-gui-unhide script can be applied to various Telstra branded Technicolor devices to unlock hidden features in the web GUI. The aim is to improve the usability of these devices without compromising stability.

## Installation

Execute this command on the device:
```
curl -skL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/master/get | sh -s --
```

Detailed [installation instructions](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/wiki/Installation) can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/wiki).

## Features

[Features](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/wiki/Features) that have been unlocked or added are shown in the [wiki](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/wiki).

## Extras

Some extra features rely on additional software packages to be installed on the device, and most are firmware version specific. When these packages are detected and the appropriate extension script has been downloaded, the web GUI will be modified to allow access to configure the additional packages:

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.adblock](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtraadblock)

Creates a GUI interface for the [`Adblock`](https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata/adblock) package that allows you to block ads at the router level.

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.minidlna](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtraminidlna)

Replaces the stock DLNA server management in the GUI so that it supports OpenWRT minidlna.

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.rsyncd](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtrarsyncd)

Adds the ability to enable and disable the rsync daemon from the GUI.

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.samba36-server](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtrasamba36-server)

Correctly configures OpenWRT SAMBA 3.6 on firmware 17.2 and 18.1.c to provide SMBv2 for Windows 10 inter-operability. This update adds the ability to change the password via the GUI.

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.speedtest](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtraspeedtest)

Creates a GUI interface for the [`Ookla SpeedtestÂ®`](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) CLI.

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.wireguard](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtrawireguard)

Creates a GUI interface for configuring the Wireguard VPN on firmware 20.3.

#### [tch-gui-unhide-xtra.wlassoclist](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/extras#tch-gui-unhide-xtrawlassoclist)

Can be installed on a Technicolor device acting as a wireless Access Point to enable the main Technicolor router (running tch-gui-unhide) to query it and correctly report devices connected via Wi-Fi, rather than showing them as Ethernet connections.

## Supplemental Features

Using the additional scripts found in sub-folders of this repository, you can configure your device with these supplemental features:

#### [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/supplemental/adguard#readme)

Allows you to install and configure [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) on your device, and _disable_ dnsmasq. AdGuard Home will then handle DNS resolution and DHCP for your local network.

#### [OpenSpeedTest](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/supplemental/speedtest#readme)

Allows you to install the [OpenSpeedTest Server](https://github.com/openspeedtest/Speed-Test) on your device, to test the performance of your Wi-Fi or your LAN in relation to your router.

#### [Wi-Fi Booster](https://github.com/seud0nym/tch-gui-unhide/tree/master/supplemental/wifi-booster#readme)

Allows you to configure an EasyMesh-capable Telstra Smart Modem (Gen 1 or Gen 2) as a "Wi-Fi Booster" to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout a home (wired back-haul only).
